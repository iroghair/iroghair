- 👋 Hi, I’m @iroghair, assistant professor at [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/ivo-roghair/) in the Chemical Process Intensification group
- 👀 I’m interested in multiphase flows, chemical process modelling and machine learning. Also 🏠 home automation, 🎮 computer games, 🏋🏼‍♂️ fitness and 🏃🏼‍♂️ running, 🥘 cooking. 
- 👨🏼‍🏫 Courses I teach are [Numerical Methods](https://tue.osiris-student.nl/#/onderwijscatalogus/extern/cursus/?cursuscode=6E5X0&collegejaar=2022) and [Practical Process Technology](https://tue.osiris-student.nl/#/onderwijscatalogus/extern/cursus/?cursuscode=6P4X0&collegejaar=2022)
- 🎓I did my PhD on [Direct Numerical Simulations of Hydrodynamics and Mass Transfer in Dense Bubbly Flows](https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/direct-numerical-simulations-of-hydrodynamics-and-mass-transfer-i)
- 📚 My postdoc in the group of [Physics of Complex Fluids](https://www.utwente.nl/en/tnw/pcf/) at University of Twente aimed at the simulation of ⚡🌊electrohydrodynamics. See the released [source code](https://github.com/iroghair/openFoamEHD) and publications [1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10404-015-1581-5) [2](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep06378)
- 👨🏼‍💻 I develop in-house codes and work with OpenFOAM-based models for CFD type calculations, and create phenomenological models (reduced order models). We use C++, Python, Matlab, although my first program was on a C64 🦕
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to apply 🧠 machine learning to improve our 👨🏼‍🔬 experimental techniques and numerical models. I use various aspects of ML, e.g. CNN for object detection and auto-regressive neural simulation models.
- 🤯 I'm also learning how to solder and [DIY electronics](https://github.com/iroghair/simonsays), 🛹 skate boarding, 🎸guitar playing and how to raise kids.
- 📫 Contact me through my work e-mail; see the website linked in the first item.
